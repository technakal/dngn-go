# DNGN GO!
DNGN GO! is a DM toolkit for rolling die and managing combat. It is a PWA that functions on mobile and web.

Most features coming soon. These things take time.

## Backlog
### Overall
* custom color schemes

### Dice Roller
* Recongifure post-roll actions so that it doesn't automatically reset mods and dice.
  - Keep both mod and dice if they push Roll repeatedly.
  - If they select a new die post-roll, reset mod.
  - Fix the error that occurs if they change die without changing modifier and roll again.
* Allow multiple types of dice in the same roll
* Add dice roll history for the last ten rolls
* Add custom dice macros

### Initiative Tracker
* Allow adding characters to the order
* Set initiative manually
* Wire up with dice roller to automatically roll die on non-PCs
* Allow tracking of damage
